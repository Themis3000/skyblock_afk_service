This project is intended to be used with the minecraft server skyblock.net

The purpose of this project is to run a minecraft account on the server 24/7 that is fully capable of selling the items produced by farms so that I can make lots of money. The way this is built, the bot should never need any downtime for any reason. The bot can be monitored and controled through a web pannel. The web pannel allows you to start and stop the bot, as well as monitor the game chat and send messages/commands from the bot user. The web pannel is very responsive since it uses web socket in order to communicate with the bot

Now, please excuse me while I get rich in minecraft.
