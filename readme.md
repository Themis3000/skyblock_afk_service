This project is intended to be used with the minecraft server skyblock.net

The purpose of this project is to run a minecraft account on the server 24/7 that is fully capable of selling the items produced by farms so that I can make lots of money. The way this is built, the bot should never need any downtime for any reason. The bot will be able to be controlled through a basic web interface as well as commands in game.

Now, please excuse me while I get rich in minecraft.
